Reports builder and Utilities to make Practice Web EMR even better

Practice-Web is Dental office practice management software based on .NET technology. This sofware has been developed on open-source "Open Dental" platform.

Practice-Web is using mySQL as its main database. It has been very easy to connect and build missing reports as well as to build data visualizations.

Note that this project is not ment to replace core functionality of Practice-Web but rather create reports and charts which might be useful in analyzing patient and financial data.

I plan to publish many scripts and report builders which I have found useful in analyzing busy dental office practice in San Francisco.

Feel free to contact me with any questions. I am also available for consulting.
