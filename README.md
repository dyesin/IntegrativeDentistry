Reports builder and Utilities to make Practice Web EMR even better

Practice-Web is Dental Office practice management software based on .NET technology. This sofware has been developed on opne-source "Open Dental" platform.

Practice-Web is using msql as it's main database. It has been easy to connect to this db and build missing reports and expose data in other visual manner.

Note that this project is not ment to replace core functionality of Practice-Web but rather create reports and charts wich might be useful to analyze patient and financial data.

I plan to publish many scripts and report builders which I have found useful in analyzing busy dental office practice in San Francisco.

Feel free to contact tme with any questions. I am also available for consulting.
