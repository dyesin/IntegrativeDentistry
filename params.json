This software has been developed on open-source \"Open Dental\" platform.\r\n\r\nPractice-Web is using mySQL as its main database. It has been very easy to connect and build missing reports as well as to build data visualizations.\r\n\r\nNote that this project is not meant to replace core functionality of Practice-Web but rather create reports and charts which might be useful in analyzing patient and financial data.\r\n\r\nI plan to publish many scripts and report builders which I have found useful in analyzing busy dental office practice in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me with any questions. I am also available for consulting.\r\n\r\nDmitry\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
